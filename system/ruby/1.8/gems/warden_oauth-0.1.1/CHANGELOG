0.1.1 (Feb 1, 2010)
* Given the warden API was updated, the redirect! method would not work
without invoking a throw(:warden) [contributor: eoin]


* 0.1.0 (Jan 9, 2010) Lets stay up to date with josevalim's work
* Renaming the warden_oauth/manager.rb to warden_oauth/config_extension.rb,
given that the Warden::Manager is not the given instance on the
Warden::Manager block anymore
* Creating a new way to assign access_token_user_finders to the strategies,
using the sole strategy had a drawback, the class was lazily created after the
first request to the Rack middleware.
* Added an example of a twitter client (given that's the more popular client
being used)
* Update of the README


* 0.0.2 (Oct 1, 2009) Keep the manager out of the business of strategies
* Removing the access_token_user_finder from Warden::Manager and adding it to
the Warden::StrategyBuilder module

* 0.0.1 (Sep 16, 2009) The beginning of easy OAuth for Warden
* Adding the initial implementation of the warden_oauth gem
